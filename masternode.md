### What is a Masternode and why should I have one? 为什么你应该有个主节点



Many of you involved in the Cryptosphere or considering investing may have heard of the term Masternode and be wondering what a Masternode is?

许多参与到加密货币世界或者考虑投资加密货币的人可能听说过主节点，而且心里还纳闷：这个主节点是啥东西？

In these articles I hope to open your eyes to the world of Masternodes, explain what they are, how they work and how to avoid the bad ones. None of these articles should be considered as investment advice however and you should always DYOR (do your own research).

在文章中我希望你们能了解一下主节点，向你们解释它们是什么，它们是怎么运转的，以及如何避免作恶的那些主节点。这里所讲的内容都不构成投资建议，你应该做好自己的研究。

#### What is a Masternode? 主节点是什么？

Before I explain what a Masternode is its worth spending a little time running through the different types of blockchain out there and which ones support running a Masternode.

在解释主节点是什么之前，值得花一点时间快速了解不同类型的区块链以及哪些支持运行主节点。

Blockchains, in broad terms, break down into three types. POW (proof of work), POS (proof of stake) and a mixture of both.

广义上来说，区块链分成三种类型：PoW（工作量证明），PoS（权益证明）以及两者的混合型。

Each of these blockchains must have a mechanism for processing transactions which allows the blockchain to function.

每一个这样的区块链必须拥有一种机制来处理让区块链运转起来的交易。

POW blockchains, such as Bitcoin, are underpinned by ‘miners’ who process transactions by ‘mining’ blocks which are then added to the blockchain. Without going into the technical detail in too much depth the mining of a block is achieved by the miners ‘rig’ (which is a computer specifically designed to process data at a very high rate) guessing the answer to a puzzle. The first mining rig to guess the answer to this puzzle correctly wins the right to mine the block. Once a block is mined the miner is also rewarded with, in this case, Bitcoin. Unfortunately POW systems are very energy intensive and the crypto industry is slowly moving over to an alternative, more energy efficient, type of blockchain called POS.

PoW区块链，比如比特币，是由矿工支撑的，他们通过挖矿来处理交易，这些交易然后加到区块链上。这里不会过多地探究技术细节。区块是由矿工（利用特别设计的电脑来高速处理数据）通过猜到一个谜题的答案来挖到的。第一个正确地猜到谜题的答案的矿工赢得挖矿的权利。一旦挖到矿，矿工就获得比特币作为奖励。不利的情况是PoW系统耗能非常高，加密货币行业正慢慢地朝着另一种更加节能的PoS区块链发展。

POS blockchains are underpinned by Masternodes. These are computers which process transactions on the blockchain and as a result are rewarded with coins from the blocks being created. Nodes sit on the blockchain, normally within a queuing system, and when they reach a certain position in this queue can be selected, at random, to be rewarded for participating within the network. As a result of this rewards can appear at different intervals but usually average out over time.

PoS区块链由主节点支撑其运作。它们是处理链上交易的电脑，获得来自于挖到区块的代币奖励。主节点是区块链的一部分，通常在一个队列系统里，当它们处于队列中某个位置时，就可能被随机地选中参与到区块链网络中。这样的一种奖励可能以不同的时间间隔出现，但是，慢慢地，这个时间通常会趋于平均值。

#### Why should I run a Masternode?为什么我应该要运行一个主节点？

Masternodes provide the opportunity to invest in Cryptocurrencies with the added benefit of earning guaranteed extra coins in addition to gaining exposure to the large potential increases in value that can come within the Cryptosphere and owning cryptocurrencies.

These coins are awarded through running a node and as covered later in this article these rewards can also be used to generate rewards on top of your rewards. Great eh?

主节点提供了这样的机会：投资加密货币，除了获得加密货币发展和拥有的加密货币可能带来的回报外，还能得到确定无疑的奖励。这些奖励通过运行主节点获得，并且它们还能用来在你获得的奖励基础上产生回报。很棒，不是吗？

#### So, what can go wrong? 可能会遇到什么问题？

Well, as with any investment there are risks and these can be significant within the Masternode world. Since the beginning of 2018 there has been an explosion in the number of Masternode coins and unfortunately this has also attracted a fair number of scammers to this space.

对任何一种投资，都存在风险。在加密货币世界里，这样的风险可能相当的高。2018伊始，主节点拥有的代币数量一直爆发性地增长，不幸的是，这也吸引了不少骗子们的注意。

Therefore this article comes with a word of warning. Be very cautious of any Masternode coin offering very high ROI percentages — anything in the 1,000% or above bracket really needs to be treated with caution and any coin that does not have a utility as well should be avoided in the early stages of it’s life. 

所以，这篇文章在这里给大家一点提醒。小心任何宣称可以获得很高投资回报率的主节点 — 任何说可以获得百倍以上的回报都要警惕，任何没有实际应用的代币项目在早期的时候都应该避开。

#### OK, I want to run a Masternode. What’s next? 我想运行一个主节点。下面要做什么？

So now we know at a basic level what a Masternode is I’ll now explain in more detail how you set-up a Masternode and how to maximise your returns from it.

现在我们大概知道了主节点是什么，我来详细地解释一下你如何设置主节点，以及如何从它身上获得最大的回报。

As explained previously a Masternode is a computer which processes transactions on a blockchain and, as a result, is rewarded with extra coins for doing so.

一个主节点是一台电脑，它处理区块链上的交易，然后，因为所做的一切它获得额外的代币奖励。

As you can probably appreciate the developers of any given blockchain want those running nodes to do so in a responsible fashion. They also want to ensure node owners do not try to disrupt the blockchain for personal gain.

正如你大概能理解区块链的开发人员希望这些运行节点以负责任的方式做这件事。他们也想确保节点的所有者不要试图为了个人利益而破坏区块链。

This is achieved by requiring a node owner to hold a certain amount of coins to ensure they have a vested interest in the blockchain and thereby ensure they run their node in a responsible fashion.

为了做到这一点，节点所有者需要持有一定数量的代币，来保证他们对区块链的既得利益。从而确保他们负责任地运行他们的节点。

For this example we’ll assume the required collateral is 10,000 coins and we’ll discuss running your node in what is called a cold wallet setup — this is the most common setup used and the one I use for all my nodes.

例如，我们假定需要保证金10000个代币，下面我们讨论在冷钱包中如何配置来运行节点 — 这是最普遍的配置方法。

1 — Buy 10,010 coins on an exchange (always buy slightly more to cover transaction fees both from the exchange and in your wallet).

1.在交易所买10010个代币（稍微多买一点，用来支付交易所和钱包的手续费。）

2 — Install the desktop wallet on your home PC and synchronise to the blockchain — some blockchains allow you to download this data separately to speed up the synchronisation step.

2.在电脑上安装桌面钱包软件，并同步至区块链的最新状态 — 有些区块链允许你单独地下载这个数据，来加速同步过程。

3 — Send your coins to your wallet.

3.把你的代币提现到你的钱包中。

4 — Setup a node address in your wallet and send your coins to the node address. This will then allow you to gather the private key and transaction information needed to set-up your node.

在钱包软件中建立一个节点地址，把你的代币发送到这个地址。然后，你可以收集私钥和所需的交易信息来配置你的节点。

5 — Set-up the node. You will have a choice whether you do this on a personal server at your home/office or on a VPS (virtual private server) at a provider’s datacentre. The two most commonly used providers are Vultr and Digital Ocean.

5.配置节点。你可以选择在家里或办公室的服务器上完成这个操作，或者也可以在服务商的数据中心的VPS上来进行操作。有两家使用很普遍的服务商：Vultr和Digital Ocean。你可以随意选择。

6 — Once the server has been built and you have installed and configured the nodes wallet you are ready to start the server. You will need to start the node ‘daemon’ at the server. The server will then synchronise with the blockchain at this point.

6.一旦服务器搭建好，并安装和配置了你准备启动服务器的节点钱包。你就要在服务器上启动‘daemon‘节点。然后，这时服务器将和区块链进行同步。

7 — Set-up the Masternode within your desktop wallet and start it up.

7.在你的桌面钱包软件中配置主节点，并启动它。

8 — At this point the node will be running and you will start to receive rewards.

8.这时，这个主节点开始运行，你就将开始接受奖励。

NB — for step 2 you may also wish to consider installing your wallet on a separate VPS (a simple windows one would probably be best as this tends to be the widest supported O/S for desktop wallets). From a security standpoint this may be preferable as this VPS will not have been used for internet browsing or have other programs installed thereby reducing any risk of having key loggers or other spyware installed.

注意：对于第二个步骤，你也许希望考虑在单独的VPS上安装钱包软件。从安全角度来说，这也许是很值得赞许的，因为VPS不会被用来上网或者安装其他的软件，这样就减少了被安装上密钥记录器或者木马软件的风险。

For most nodes you can safely shutdown the computer hosting your desktop wallet without impacting the node BUT if you want to ‘stake’ your rewards you will need to keep the desktop wallet open and running 24/7. If you wish to stake rewards, using a separate window VPS for the wallet may be preferable. These are the rewards on top of your rewards.

对大多数节点来说，你可以安全地关掉运行桌面钱包软件的电脑，并不会影响到节点。但是，如果你想“赌上”你的奖励，你需要让桌面钱包软件一直打开，全年无休。如果你想赌上奖励，给这个钱包软件使用一个单独的VPS是非常不错的做法。这些都能让你的回报带来奖励。

#### So, how do I earn these rewards on top of my rewards?我如何获得这些奖励？

Staking rewards, if allowed for the specific blockchain, should definitely be considered if you are not selling your node rewards. Whether you are holding them to build enough for a new node or whether you are just holding hoping for the market price to increase staking can be used to ensure these coins continue to work for you. Normally all you need to do is ensure your wallet is configured to allow staking (normally achieved via the wallet settings or configuration file change) and then leave the host computer switched on, connected to the internet and the wallet left open. Once your coins have matured (varies but around 11 hours is common) they will be staked in the network and you will then be eligible to earn rewards.

如果考虑到具体的区块链，你要是不卖掉你的节点奖励，那么赌上你的奖励应该具体对待。不论你是持有它们来为新节点做准备，还是只希望价格上涨，能够用这样的赌注来保证这些代币继续为你带来可观的回报。通常来说，你要做的就是确保配置好你的钱包允许”冒险“，然后让主机运行，连接到互联网，钱包软件打开。一旦你的代币奖励产生（这个时间会变，但通常是在11小时左右），它们就会被放到网络上，然后你就有资格获得这个奖励。

When staking it is always worth ensuring your staked coins are not ‘staked’ as a single group. Once a group of staked coins earns a reward those coins then become immature and ineligible for staking until matured. Grouping coins into staking groups is a judgement call but on average I try to collate coins into groups of 1,000 to ensure enough ‘network weight’ — basically your chance of getting a reward allocated. Splitting into groups also gives you more chances of being selected as well — think of it as buying more than one ticket to the lottery. Multiple groups equals more tickets and bigger groups of coins increases the chance of winning with that group. Grouping coins can be done via the coin control function in your wallet and you just send yourself these coins 1,000 at a time — just make sure you don’t send any of your node collateral as this would stop your node working!

在进行这样的”冒险“时，值得注意的是，要确保你的”赌资“不要单枪匹马地来”加注“。一旦你单独地用”赌资“来获取奖励时，这些奖励就不能用来”加注“直到它们有资格加入。把代币分组进行投注是个不错的方式，但是，平均来说，我会试着把代币分成1000个一组，来保证足够的”网络权重“ — 你获得分配的奖励的机会。分组也给你更多被选中的机会 — 把这想象成多买几张彩票。更多的组相当于更多的彩票，这增加了中奖的机会。你可以在钱包软件中进行设置来完成代币的分组，然后你只需要向你自己一次发送1000个代币即可 — 要确保你不会发送你的节点的保证金，因为这样会让你的节点停止工作。

I hope the above has opened your eyes a little into the world of Masternodes.

我希望上面所讲的内容让你对主节点的世界有了一点点认识。
